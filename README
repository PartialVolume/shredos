shredos is a simple linux distribution that aims to shred your disks.
It boots in 2 seconds, lists your disk and allow you to wipe using different algorithms.

It uses nwipe as interface which supports several method:
- dod522022m / dod       - 7 pass DOD 5220.22-M method
- dodshort / dod3pass    - 3 pass DOD method
- gutmann                - Peter Gutmann's Algorithm
- ops2                   - RCMP TSSIT OPS-II
- random / prng / stream - PRNG Stream
- zero / quick           - Overwrite with zeros

and several pseudorandom number generator:
- mersenne
- twister
- isaac

The system is built using buildroot.
The final system size is about 12MB but due to minimim fat32 partition size, the ending image is about 37MB and can be burnt with a tool such as dd or Etcher.

You can build the image by doing:
$ git clone git@github.com:nadenislamarre/shredos.git
$ cd shredos
$ make shredos_defconfig
$ make
$ ls output/images/shredos*.img
